## CodeLeap Coding Test

Welcome to the CodeLeap coding test! The goal is to create a very simple application that will perform basic CRUD functions.

### Frontend

If you're applying for frontend, please feel free to choose either React or React-Native to build this application.

This example is designed for the web, but if you choose to build it with React-Native for mobile, feel free to do the necessary UI changes to fit the different device requirements.

### Backend

If you're applying for backend, please use Django and DRF to build this application. You do not need to build any frontend/UI, just the API endpoints to make the application work as the documentation.

### Fullstack

If you're applying with both frontend and backend positions in mind, please complete both tests so they work together.

Please feel free to use any packages or tools you want in addition to the core ones above.

### Completion and Delivery

Please upload your code to a repository we can access and let us know when it's ready.

Please deploy the code somewhere so we have a working testable version. If you are using React-Native, please make sure your code is easy to run in any platform. If we can't run it, we won't assess it.

Make sure you read all instructions and details on the right side of this page.
